# **Understanding Financial Statements**

Financial statements are formal reports that communicate an organization's financial status. They serve as a crucial tool for investors, lenders, and regulatory authorities.

Public companies in the U.S. are required by the **Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)** to submit financial reports. However, even private companies prepare them to attract investors, secure loans, or for acquisition purposes.

## **1. Components of Financial Statements**

Financial statements typically include four key components:

1. **Balance Sheet** – A snapshot of a company’s assets, liabilities, and equity at a specific point in time.
2. **Income Statement** – Summarizes revenue, expenses, and profits over a period.
3. **Statement of Cash Flows** – Tracks cash inflows and outflows from operating, investing, and financing activities.
4. **Owner’s Equity Statement** – Shows changes in the company’s retained earnings and equity.

### **Consolidation of Financial Statements**

Larger corporations with multiple subsidiaries consolidate their financial statements. This makes it difficult to assess the financial performance of individual subsidiaries, leading to challenges in determining whether they contribute to or drain shareholder value.

Even within a company, interpreting financial statements can be complex because accountants use **assumptions and discretion** when reporting certain financial activities. This can lead to biases in reported earnings.

**Examples of Accounting Discretion:**

- **Depreciation Schedules:** Accountants choose depreciation methods, but they cannot precisely determine an asset’s lifespan.
- **Inventory Costing Methods:** Different inventory valuation methods (FIFO, LIFO, Weighted Average) impact tax obligations and reported profits.

Although the underlying assets and inventory flows remain unchanged, these choices influence reported net income and tax payments.

## **2. Reporting Requirements and Timing**

### **Regulatory Filings for Public Companies**

Public corporations must disclose financial information periodically through SEC filings:

- **Annual Reports (10-K)** – Detailed yearly report with audited financial statements.
- **Quarterly Reports (10-Q)** – Unaudited reports filed every quarter.
- **Current Reports (8-K)** – Used to disclose major events that shareholders should be aware of.

### **Fiscal Year vs. Calendar Year**

A company’s fiscal year may not align with the calendar year. Some companies structure their fiscal year to optimize financial reporting.

For example, **Target Corporation’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31**. This allows for accurate post-holiday season accounting, including reconciliations of returns and year-end inventory.

## **3. Accounting Standards and Methods**

### **GAAP vs. IFRS**

To ensure consistency, financial reporting adheres to accounting standards:

- **GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles)** – U.S. public companies must follow GAAP.
- **IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards)** – Many countries follow IFRS instead of GAAP.

When comparing companies across different countries, it is essential to understand whether they report under **GAAP or non-GAAP** standards, as accounting treatments may differ.

### **Accrual vs. Cash Basis Accounting**

Companies can record financial transactions using one of the following methods:

|**Method**|**Revenue Recognition**|**Expense Recognition**|**Common Usage**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Accrual Basis** (GAAP-compliant)|Recognized when earned|Recognized when incurred|Required for public companies and large firms|
|**Cash Basis**|Recognized when cash is received|Recognized when cash is paid|Often used by small businesses|

Smaller businesses may opt for **cash basis accounting** since they don’t have extensive accounts receivable or payable. However, **GAAP requires accrual basis accounting**, meaning that public companies must use the accrual method.

The **disparity between revenue and expense recognition under these methods highlights the need for all four financial statements** to get a complete financial picture.

## **4. Additional Financial Statements and Adjustments**

While the standard financial statements provide key insights, companies may issue additional reports that can impact financial analysis.

### **Pro Forma Financial Statements**

Be cautious when evaluating **pro forma financial statements**, as they can obscure the true financial position of a company.

- **Definition:** Pro forma statements exclude nonrecurring or one-time unusual charges to present a more favorable view of a company's financial health.
- **Purpose:** Management uses pro forma statements to illustrate how the company might perform under **"normal"** conditions, excluding rare or one-time events.
- **Risk Factor:** Some companies might use pro forma adjustments to **inflate profitability** or **mislead investors**. The **SEC monitors** companies that manipulate financial reports through aggressive pro forma adjustments.

### **Why Are Pro Forma Statements Used?**

- To provide a **clearer future outlook** by excluding extraordinary expenses.
- To reflect **projected financial performance** in mergers, acquisitions, or restructuring.
- To reassure investors that **one-time losses won’t affect long-term profitability**.

However, **managerial competence plays a role** in whether pro forma reporting is transparent or misleading. The SEC warns that fraudulent use of pro forma statements can lead to investigations.

# **What Are Financial Statements Used For?**

Financial statements serve as a critical tool for decision-making.

## **1. Three Principal Business Activities**

From an accounting perspective, firms engage in three key activities:
### **a. Financing Activities (Obtaining Money)**

- Borrowing money from banks or lenders, with repayment plus interest.

The data collected from these activities are used by **internal and external users** to guide financial, operational, and strategic decisions.

### **a. Internal Users (Managerial Accounting)**

Management utilizes financial data for decisions in:

1. **Finance** – Dividend payments, debt vs. equity funding, debt repayment strategies, stock buybacks.

3. **Marketing** – Product mix, pricing strategies, advertising, market expansion.
